# WhisperWeb: Your Safe Space for Sensitive Topics on Campus
## TID Course Project

## Product Description
WhisperWeb is an online platform tailored for university students. Drawing inspiration from cherished penpal friendships, it presents a digital realm where students can confidently engage in anonymous 1:1 chats or partake in group discussions, especially on sensitive topics such as academic stress, substance abuse, body image, career anxiety, and harassment. The platform's authentication ensures genuine interactions while upholding user anonymity.

## Vision and Purpose
WhisperWeb seeks to modernise the experience of penpal connections in the digital age. Recognizing the unique challenges university students face, ranging from academic stressors to sensitive personal issues, WhisperWeb aspires to be a sanctuary. Here, students can voice their concerns, find community support, and foster meaningful connections in a judgement-free environment.

## Target Users
WhisperWeb is tailored for university students from diverse backgrounds and situations. It provides a platform for students, especially those new to the university setting, seeking to communicate authentically and find solace, particularly concerning sensitive campus topics. Through detailed personas in Section 3, WhisperWeb showcases its dedication to fostering an inclusive and supportive digital environment for all students.

## Potential Institutional Collaboration
We contacted CBS Student Affairs, which handles students' sensitive concerns, including harassment issues, at Copenhagen Business School. This organisation collaborates with campus pastors and boasts a team of trained coaching counsellors. We believe institutions of this nature could benefit as potential customers, potentially moderating the platform or hosting a white label solution to provide a more scalable discussion of sensitive matters on campus. The response is pending.
